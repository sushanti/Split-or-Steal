### EMOTION MODELLING IN ITERATIVE PRISONERâ€™S DILEMMA USING FACS AND ML TECHNIQUES

We are interested to study the influence of game behavior and facial expressions of the player in the previous rounds to predict if the opponent will cooperate or defect in the next round of an iterative social dilemma game (inspired by the British television game show Golden Balls).

### Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/sushanti/Split-or-Steal.git

### Prerequisites

```
1. Python 3.0 and above
2. Jupyter Notebook
```

### Running the tests

1. Run code.ipynb notebook
2. The code uses training_data.csv file to train the model
3. The engineered features can be viewed in tranformed.csv file (after running)
