## Introducing Emotion Expressions into Opponent Modelling for Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma

We are interested to study the influence of game states and facial expressions of the player to predict if the opponent will cooperate or defect in the next round of an iterative social dilemma game (inspired by the British television game show Split or Steal).

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/sushanti/Split-or-Steal.git

### Prerequisites

```
1. Python 3.0 and above
2. Jupyter Notebook
```

## Running the tests

1. Run code.ipynb notebook
2. The code uses game_data.csv file as training data
3. The engineering featured can be viewed in tranformed.csv file
